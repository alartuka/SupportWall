## What it does âœ¨ 

Support Wall offers categories where you can add sticky notes anonymously. These categories include Ranting, Jokes, Family, School and good news, where you can add sticky notes under a word limit. We wanted to highlight safety and connection because we want people to be able to connect without avatars or names. This still allows them to feel connected and does not expose personal and identifying information without their consent. Most people surveyed enjoyed the anonymity, citing it as essential in creating a safe and fulfilling experience. An overarching motivation from users is enjoying the ranting and safety aspect of the website, where users feel like they are connecting as a community online.
